# Crossplane & GitOps - a perfect match?

This talk will explore the combination of Crossplane and GitOps for automating infrastructure management. Attendees will
follow our team's journey from manual deployments over Terraform to the benefits of GitOps, ending in how Crossplane can
help manage infrastructure as code to automate the creation and maintenance of cloud resources. We will also cover the
basics of GitOps and how it enables teams to manage infrastructure through code changes.

Throughout the session, Katharina will share their experiences combining GitOps and Crossplane, including best
practices, pitfalls, and what they would do differently now.

## Examples

See the README.md files of each [example directory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KatharinaSick/PresentationMaterials/main/20230328-CloudNativeLinz/examples) for instructions about the examples. Before any example is executed,
the setup which is described in [00-init](./examples/00-init) has to be completed.
