# Simplifying Development with Developer Platforms: A Beginner's Overview

Developer platforms are designed to make developers' lives easier. When built with the end user in mind, they can
streamline workflows, foster collaboration, and speed up innovation. In essence, they act as a helpful assistant that
takes care of the complex behind-the-scenes work, freeing developers to focus on what they usually do best â€“ building
great software.

This talk is a starting point for anyone interested in creating such platforms. We'll discuss key considerations like
how much complexity to abstract away, how to maintain flexibility for developers, and how to cater to individual needs.
By the end, you'll have a clearer understanding of how developer platforms can simplify the development process and
improve the overall experience for everyone involved.
