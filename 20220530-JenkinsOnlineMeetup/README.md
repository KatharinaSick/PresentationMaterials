# Kickstarting CI Best Practices with Jenkins in Autonomous Teams

When developing a project, there are many things to consider. It's not just about the code itself, but also about
building, testing and packaging everything. Making this process easier is the main goal for the Engineering Productivity
teams at Dynatrace.

Join us in this talk to learn about how we are utilizing Jenkins to ease the process of building and delivering
applications for hundreds of developers. You'll see how our Jenkins instances are running in a Kubernetes cluster, how
they are provisioned via Configuration as Code with minimal overhead and which tools are used to get the most out of our
workflow. Additionally, we'll add a live demo to show how all of these components can work together.
