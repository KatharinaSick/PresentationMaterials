# Finding My Passion: Kubernetes, Community, and the Joy of Developer Experience

Like many developers, the world of deployments and CI/CD pipelines made me want to run for the hills. But then I
stumbled into the Cloud Native world, and everything changed!

Even though I'm still relatively new to the game (about three years in), I've become hooked on how Kubernetes and its
ecosystem empower platform engineers to make a significant impact on developer productivity and experience. In this
talk, I'll share my journey and what keeps me excited about Kubernetes â€“ the fantastic open source community, the
incredible levels of collaboration, and how it's changing the way we think about software delivery.
