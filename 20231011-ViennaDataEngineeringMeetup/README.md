# To Containers and Beyond - Kubernetes as a Universal Control Plane

Slides & examples for my talk at
the [Vienna Data Engineering Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/vienna-data-engineering-meetup/).

Created with [Slidev](https://sli.dev/) & deployed

## Abstract

Kubernetes has evolved beyond container orchestration - it is a powerful tool for managing diverse resources, from
deployments to infrastructure and cloud resources. It is designed for extensibility and offers a robust foundation for
more than just deployments. This talk will dive into the exciting world of extending Kubernetes. We'll explore how
Crossplane, an open source CNCF project, takes Kubernetes to a new level and enhances it to a versatile control plane.
Further, it'll cover how GitOps can boost this powerful combination by providing automation, security, improved
collaboration and more.
