title: 'Securing Kubernetes Clusters: The Principle of Least Privilege with ArgoCD and Crossplane'
summary: According to OWASP, insecure workload configuration is the top security problem in Kubernetes. As modern Kubernetes clusters evolve from mere container orchestrators to versatile control planes managing various types of resources, protecting these clusters becomes even more critical.

# Securing Kubernetes Clusters: The Principle of Least Privilege with ArgoCD and Crossplane

According to OWASP, insecure workload configuration is the top security problem in Kubernetes. As modern Kubernetes
clusters evolve from mere container orchestrators to versatile control planes managing various types of resources,
protecting these clusters becomes even more critical. In this talk, you'll learn practical strategies to address
security problems in your Kubernetes cluster by applying the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP). Moreover, we'll extend
this principle to ArgoCD and Crossplane, two powerful tools used in many Kubernetes clusters. Join me to discover how
the Principle of Least Privilege, applied to Kubernetes, ArgoCD, and Crossplane, empowers you to safeguard your
Kubernetes ecosystem.
