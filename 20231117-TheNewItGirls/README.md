# Getting started with Containers and Kubernetes: A Beginner's Workshop

This workshop is a step by step journey into the world of containers and Kubernetes. Whether you're new to these
technologies or simply looking for a better understanding, join us for 4 hours of hands-on learning to tackle the
notorious "works on my machine" challenge.

To kick things off, we'll introduce ourselves and share our experiences working with containers and Kubernetes. You'll
learn how these technologies have transformed how we develop and deploy software, making it easier and more consistent.
We'll start by understanding containers - consider them self-contained packages with all the necessary ingredients for
running an application. Using Docker, we'll guide you through creating these containers, ensuring that your applications
work seamlessly across different systems. Next, we'll dive into Kubernetes, an intelligent tool that helps manage your
containers effortlessly. We'll explain key concepts like load balancing (spreading the workload evenly) and scaling (
adapting to handle more traffic). You'll see how Kubernetes automatically takes care of these tasks, allowing your
applications to run smoothly even under heavy demand.

Throughout the workshop, you'll have the chance to follow along with coding exercises, and we will be there to support
you every step of the way. By the end, you'll have gained practical experience and the confidence to incorporate
containers and Kubernetes into your own projects.
