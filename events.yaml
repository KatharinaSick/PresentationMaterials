  - title: "Build Their Platform, Not Yours: Empowering Developers"
    abstract: |
      Developer platforms are designed to make developers' lives easier. When built with the end user in mind, they can streamline workflows, foster collaboration, and speed up innovation. In essence, they act as a helpful assistant that takes care of the complex behind-the-scenes work, freeing developers to focus on what they usually do best – building great software.

      This naturally leads us to some critical questions: How much of the underlying complexity should these platforms abstract away? How can we empower developers with helpful tools without making their work feel rigid? And how can we cater to the diverse needs and preferences within development teams?
      
      This talk will explore various approaches to crafting opinionated user interfaces and compare their strengths and weaknesses. We'll journey from the concept of the thinnest viable platform (TVP) to the pitfalls of over-engineering, where meaningful abstractions turn into limitations.

  - title: Crossplane Observability & Traceability for Effective Multi-Cloud Management
    abstract: |
      Companies adopting cloud-native technologies increasingly use declarative definitions of cloud infrastructure. This shift offers excellent scalability, flexibility and agility opportunities, but also comes with challenges: What if resource creation takes longer than expected? What if resources fail to materialize at all? How to identify problems and potential performance optimizations? The answer lies in a familiar strategy: as in software development, we can address these challenges through instrumentation and leveraging observability data to uncover patterns, pinpoint root causes, and drive informed optimizations.

      Join to learn how to answer those questions using existing metrics, logs and distributed traces emitted by tools like Crossplane, a popular open source CNCF project. The presenters will walk you through their best practices for making declarative cloud infrastructure traceable and leverage this data to improve issue resolution and your cloud infrastructure's reliability.

  - title: "Pathways, Not Pitfalls: Building Platforms With Developers in Mind"
    abstract: |
      When implemented with the end user in mind, developer platforms can take away a lot of cognitive load from developers and help streamline workflows, improve collaboration and accelerate innovation. By building meaningful abstractions and templates, we can remove a vast amount of complexity from developers. But how much complexity should be hidden? How can we ensure we provide the appropriate level of freedom? And how can we cope with every developer's individual needs?

      This talk will explore various approaches to crafting opinionated user interfaces and compare their strengths and weaknesses. We'll journey from the concept of the thinnest viable platform (TVP) to the pitfalls of over-engineering, where meaningful abstractions turn into illusions.

  - title: "Getting started with Containers and Kubernetes: A Beginners Workshop"
    abstract: |
      This workshop is a step by step journey into the world of containers and Kubernetes. Whether you're new to these technologies or simply looking for a better understanding, join us for 4 hours of hands-on learning to tackle the notorious "works on my machine" challenge.

      To kick things off, we'll introduce ourselves and share our experiences working with containers and Kubernetes. You'll learn how these technologies have transformed how we develop and deploy software, making it easier and more consistent. We'll start by understanding containers - consider them self-contained packages with all the necessary ingredients for running an application. Using Docker, we'll guide you through creating these containers, ensuring that your applications work seamlessly across different systems. Next, we'll dive into Kubernetes, an intelligent tool that helps manage your containers effortlessly. We'll explain key concepts like load balancing (spreading the workload evenly) and scaling (adapting to handle more traffic). You'll see how Kubernetes automatically takes care of these tasks, allowing your applications to run smoothly even under heavy demand.

      Throughout the workshop, you'll have the chance to follow along with coding exercises, and we will be there to support you every step of the way. By the end, you'll have gained practical experience and the confidence to incorporate containers and Kubernetes into your own projects.

      According to OWASP, insecure workload configuration is the top security problem in Kubernetes. As modern Kubernetes clusters evolve from mere container orchestrators to versatile control planes managing various resources, minimizing the attack surface of these clusters becomes even more critical.

      But security shouldn't come at the expense of user experience. This talk will cover the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) and how it can be applied to balance robust security and a good experience for users and administrators. Moreover, it will extend this principle to ArgoCD and Crossplane and explore the differences between the PoLP and Zero Trust and how they're complementary.

  - title: Crossplane & GitOps - A Perfect Match?
    abstract: |
      This talk will explore the combination of Crossplane and GitOps for automating infrastructure management. Attendees will follow our team's journey from manual deployments over Terraform to the benefits of GitOps, ending in how Crossplane can help manage infrastructure as code to automate the creation and maintenance of cloud resources. We will also cover the basics of GitOps and how it enables teams to manage infrastructure through code changes.

      Throughout the session, Katharina will share their experiences combining GitOps and Crossplane, including best practices, pitfalls, and what they would do differently now.

  - title: Kickstarting CI Best Practices with Jenkins in Autonomous Teams
    abstract: |
      When developing a project, there are many things to consider. It's not just about the code itself, but also about building, testing and packaging everything. Making this process easier is the main goal for the Engineering Productivity teams at Dynatrace.

      Join us in this talk to learn about how we are utilizing Jenkins to ease the process of building and delivering applications for hundreds of developers. You'll see how our Jenkins instances are running in a Kubernetes cluster, how they are provisioned via Configuration as Code with minimal overhead and which tools are used to get the most out of our workflow. Additionally, we'll add a live demo to show how all of these components can work together.

  - title: RESTful Webservices mit Spring Boot
    abstract: |
      Die Kommunikation zwischen Front- und Backend einer App erfolgt oft über eine sogenannte REST API. Dabei stellt das Backend bestimmte Methoden zur Verfügung, die Clients benutzen können. Doch wie funktioniert so eine REST API eigentlich und was sollte man dabei beachten?

      In diesem Workshop werden wir einen einfachen Web Service mit Spring Boot implementieren.

      Um an diesem Workshop teilzunehmen, solltest du folgendes auf deinem Computer installieren:

      Java mit Version 1.8 oder höher
      Eine Enwicklungsumgebung wie Intellij IDEA (bevorzugt) oder Eclipse (wenn du schon Erfahrung damit hast)
