## Abstract

According to OWASP, insecure workload configuration is the top security problem in Kubernetes. As modern Kubernetes
clusters evolve from mere container orchestrators to versatile control planes managing various resources, minimizing the
attack surface of these clusters becomes even more critical.

But security shouldn't come at the expense of user experience. This talk will cover the Principle of Least Privilege (
PoLP) and how it can be applied to balance robust security and a good experience for users and administrators. Moreover,
it will extend this principle to ArgoCD and Crossplane and explore the differences between the PoLP and Zero Trust and
how they're complementary.

Join me to discover how the Principle of Least Privilege, applied to Kubernetes, ArgoCD, and Crossplane, empowers you to
safeguard your Kubernetes ecosystem without making yourself and your users suffer.

## Lessons Learned

- Breathing is hard, no matter how many dry-runs I do.
- I need to simplify my team stories. For me they are clear but for others they can be hard to follow.
- QR codes on slides are really useful.
    - The one that points to LinkedIn worked well too.
    - Consider using QR codes for sources?
- Telling a small anecdote or asking people how they like the conference can be a nice opening and makes people to stop
  talking and enter the room before the presentation actually starts.
- Organizers, other speakers and the audience are nice people! They want you to do well and it's ok to make mistakes.
- Repeat questions if there is nobody going around with the microphone. I need to create a note about this somewhere
  because I completely forgot about it.
- I think I prefer putting the badge off before the presentation.
