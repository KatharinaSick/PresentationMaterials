# Build Their Platform, Not Yours: Empowering Developers

Developer platforms are designed to make developers' lives easier. When built with the end user in mind, they can
streamline workflows, foster collaboration, and speed up innovation. In essence, they act as a helpful assistant that
takes care of the complex behind-the-scenes work, freeing developers to focus on what they usually do best â€“ building
great software.

This naturally leads us to some critical questions: How much of the underlying complexity should these platforms
abstract away? How can we empower developers with helpful tools without making their work feel rigid? And how can we
cater to the diverse needs and preferences within development teams?

This talk will explore various approaches to crafting opinionated user interfaces and compare their strengths and
weaknesses. We'll journey from the concept of the thinnest viable platform (TVP) to the pitfalls of over-engineering,
where meaningful abstractions turn into limitations.
